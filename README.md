# 🎓 Student Management System

Hey everyone! 👋 

I'm super excited to share my **Student Management System** project with you! This is my first major full-stack web application, and I've put my heart and soul into making it look professional and work smoothly. 

## 🌟 What I Built

I created a complete **Student Management System** that helps schools manage students, attendance, grades, fees, and more! It's like a digital school office that teachers and admins can use to keep track of everything.

### ✨ Cool Features I Added:

- **👥 Student Management**: Add, edit, and manage student records
- **📚 Classes & Subjects**: Organize academic classes and subjects  
- **📅 Attendance Tracking**: Mark and track student attendance
- **📊 Grades & Marks**: Record and manage student grades
- **💰 Fee Management**: Handle student fees and payments
- **📈 Reports & Analytics**: Generate reports and view statistics
- **👤 User Management**: Admin and teacher accounts with profile pictures!
- **📁 Import/Export**: Upload student data from CSV files

## 🎨 Design & UI

I'm really proud of the design! I made it:
- **🌈 Colorful**: Each page has its own color theme (green for students, purple for classes, etc.)
- **📱 Responsive**: Works perfectly on phones, tablets, and computers
- **✨ Modern**: Clean, professional look with smooth animations
- **🎯 User-Friendly**: Easy to navigate and understand
